# Introduction: we check if, once we control for EE, NB, and NE, the experimental conditions still affect the dictatorsâ€™ decision. Furthermore, we also control for CRT, sex and income. 
# In the following analysis we use Tobit regressions since the main dependent variable, Got, is bounded on both sides and has a non-negligible number of extreme values.
