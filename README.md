# Repository for Reproducible Research Group Project

The goal of this repository is to recreate the findings from [Delaying and motivating decisions in the (Bully) dictator game](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804323001325?fbclid=IwAR0jo_iPAZtn05fiXHovSlxtIeclyaRfO0xiwMJH6_gkmi5fh9JYDKGheJA) from Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics.

## Paper
### Objective of the paper
To compare the effects of a time delay condition and a motivated delay condition (with respect to a baseline condition) on allocation decisions in the Dictator Game, for both the bully and non-bully variants.

### Methods

#### Manipulations:

- Time Delay: Participants wait a specified time before making their decision.
- Motivated Delay: Participants write a motivation for their decision and wait before submitting.
- Control: Immediate decision without delay or requirement for justification.

### Measures
- Main Outcome: Amount of money allocated to the other participant in the Dictator Game.
- Secondary Outcomes: Empirical expectations, normative beliefs, and normative expectations related to altruistic behavior, measured through a pre-experiment survey and post-decision questionnaire.
- Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT): To assess the influence of cognitive style on decision-making.

### Data
All of the data required has been provided by the authors.

### Analysis

- Descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
- Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests to compare allocations across different conditions.
- Tobit regression analyzes to control for individual differences and cognitive styles.
