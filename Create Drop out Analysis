# Drop out Analysis

# In this section, a smaller dataset is created and it is verified against the hypothesis observed in the full dataset

# This piece of code shortens the dataset for specific conditions and data observations. 
# Frequency tables for these new variables are generated to examine their distributions, and finally, the dataset is restored to its original state before these manipulations were performed.

# As per author's observation, while the findings of the main analysis regarding the effects
# of the experimental conditions on Got are confirmed by the Tobit
# regression, we also see that such findings are not washed out by
# controlling for elicited variables, which in turn appear not to be affected
# by the experimental conditions. 


# The occurrence of dropouts is one of the limitations of the online experimental setting. 
# However, this occurrence is rare in our experiment (0.5 percent drop out from the experiment overall
# at least to some extent, it can be ascribed to exogenous factors.
