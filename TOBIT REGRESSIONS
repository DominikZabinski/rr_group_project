# Tobit regression models with the specified conditions

# Tobit regression modelsis a specialized statistical model designed to handle scenarios where the dependent variable is censored. Censoring occurs when the variable of interest is only observable within a certain range.
# This type of model is essential for accurately analyzing data where traditional regression techniques may fall short due to the limitations imposed by censoring.

# This is an elementary analysis to explore the relationships between variables in a Tobit regression setting.
# the tobit regression limits were selected on the basis of the distribution/ variance on the dependent variable and its relationship to other independent variables

# This part shows that the Model 1,4,6 are the ones where we see strong dependence of dependent variable upon the combo of the independent variables

# Here are the experimental conditions of the above models:
#   kept ~ bully + attention, left = 0, right = 60
 
#   kept ~ moc1 + moc2:ee + moc2:ne + moc2:nb, left = 0, right = 60, data = subset(df_, bully == 0)
 
#   kept ~ moc1 + moc2:ee + moc2:ne + moc2:nb, left = 0, right = 60, data = subset(df_, bully == 1)

# Based on this, the secondary analysis is performed to check the exact relationship in detail
